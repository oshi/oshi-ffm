/**
 * The presence of this annotation indicates that the author believes the class
 * to be immutable and hence inherently thread-safe. An immutable class is one
 * where the state of an instance cannot be <i>seen</i> to change. As a result
 * <ul>
 * <li>All public fields must be {@code final}</li>
 * <li>All public final reference fields are either {@code null} or refer to
 * other immutable objects</li>
 * <li>Constructors and methods do not publish references to any potentially
 * mutable internal state.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Performance optimization may mean that instances of an immutable class may
 * have mutable internal state. The critical point is that callers cannot tell
 * the difference. For example {@link String} is an immutable class, despite
 * having an internal int that is non-final but used as a cache for
 * {@link String#hashCode()}.
 * <p>
 * Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed between
 * threads or published without synchronization.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is intended for internal use in OSHI as a temporary
 * workaround until it is available in {@code jakarta.annotations}.
